The file [Problem_statement.md](https://github.com/arnav4567/pclub_task_cp/blob/master/Problem_statement.md) contains the proposed problem statement. The editorial to this problem is provided in [Editorial.md](https://github.com/arnav4567/pclub_task_cp/blob/master/Editorial.md) and a sample solution in [solcode.cpp](https://github.com/arnav4567/pclub_task_cp/blob/master/solcode.cpp).\
The code to generate randomised test cases is in the directory [test_cases_gen](https://github.com/arnav4567/pclub_task_cp/tree/master/test_cases_gen). This contains a .cpp file and a .txt file to save the data.\
Finally, I also tried to think of some modifications to change the difficullty of the original problem. These are explained in the file [Problem_tweaks.md](https://github.com/arnav4567/pclub_task_cp/blob/master/Problem_tweaks/Problem_tweaks.md).\
A solution to the first modification is written in [prob_tweak1_solution.cpp](https://github.com/arnav4567/pclub_task_cp/blob/master/Problem_tweaks/prob_tweak1_solution.cpp).
